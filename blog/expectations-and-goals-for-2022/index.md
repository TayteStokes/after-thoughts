This is a post that I was hoping to have created for 2021, but I failed to do that so this is me giving it another attempt.

I'm coming into the new year in a pretty fresh state. I'm just finishing my current employment of two and a half years with MX and starting a new role as a software engineer with Podium, so I thought now is the perfect time to create a new personal site where I can expirement with new technologies, document new learnings and ideas, and really anything else that I want to add to this.

I'm working on outlining a set of goals that I would like accomplish this next year as well as habits that I would like to form. This post is pretty much going to list these out with a few details about each item. I plan on looking back at this post at the end of next year and do a little compare and contrast section to see what I was able to accomplish and how the actual year differed from my own expectations.

## 1. Become more data driven

Lately, I feel like I have been kind of stuck in the same spot. I can't really tell if I am growing in anyway and it's been starting to take a hit on me mentally. I'm the kind of person that loves to feel like I'm making progress, but lately it seems like I haven't felt that and things seem to be stagnate. I've been thinking about how to break this loop of never feeling like I'm making progress and I've come to the conclussion that I'm not observing my progress correctly. I'm currently not keeping track of anything that I learn, any wins that I might have, etc.

I'm focusing on solving this issue by starting to become more efficient with keeping those records and using that data to track my progress and to help inform me with future decisions that I'll need to make. My former CTO always talked about following the data and using it as the single source of truth. He was right, the data never lies. This is primarily the motivation behind creating this new personal site that I plan on using as a blog to start documenting the cool things that I learn and who knows, maybe someone will see this and also gain some value from it. It's a win-win situation.

## 2. Continually learn

One thing that really persuaded my decision in leaving my current role at MX and to join Podium is that fact that I'm going to have the opportunity to learn some cool new tech (the pay bump is also pretty nice). I've realized that I feel the most fulfilled in my life when I am able to learn something new and implement those new learnings some way into my life. This year I am striving to have more of those moments.

## 3. Read more books

I think this goal follows pretty closely with continually learning. I always find myself doing someting pretty unproductive in my free time and it's not like I think that it's a bad thing because we need to have a break every now and then, but the problem starts when it becomes too much. There's so much knowledge and entertainment packed into the pages of a book that I'm not taking advantage of. This year I plan to unplug from the ad machines of social media and youtube videos and spend more time expanding my knowledge through reading more books.

## 4. Expand my horizons

Some of the raddest and most interesting people that I know are the ones who are always trying new things. I feel like it's easy to stuck in your comfort zone and give yourself a million and one reasons as to why you shouldn't leave it, but personal growth is hard and doesn't come from staying where you are comfortable. I'm focusing on getting into more uncomfortable situations and expanding my horizons by trying new things.

## 5. Be passionate

I had the privilege to see my former CTO, Brandon Dewitt, give a presentation where he mentions that he sent an email to himself with a list of guidelines about how he wanted to start living his life. Those guidelines included one that stated "Be passionate to the pouint of ridicule". This is something that stuck with me and has been on my mind lately. Life really is short and time is something that we won't get back. It's not worth it to shy away from expressing the passion that you have for the things that you love.

I'm excited and also anxious for this new year, but I plan to do everything I can to make the most of it. Here's to 2022.
