Hey, I'm Tayte and welcome to After Thoughts! This is a software development blog that I plan on using as a resource to document
and share what I learn during my software development journey.

I have been wanting to create a platform like this for a while now, but I just haven't been able to get around to doing it until now.

The motivation behind creating this is to have a "single source of truth" that I can use to reference what I learn and it's a bonus if others
are able to find value in what I document.

I used to work as a mentor for a coding bootcamp and found a ton of value and purpose in being able to share
what I know and help others in their journey. I'm hoping to find that value and purpose again through this platform.

Thanks for stopping by and I hope that you'll stick around!
